# Network-Security-Hardening
This project focuses on reducing the attack surface of a windows 10 virtual machine.  After identifying ports through a Nmap scan, then any unnecessary ports will be closed while ensuring that Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) remains accessible in a controlled manner.  This uses concepts from my Security+ and Network+ certifications.
